# LSM_Brainlike_STDP

This is a repo for my research code. 

This is basically a simulator for spiking neuron networks with STDP rule implemented. 

The code can be run in parallel because I implement p-thread here.

I have optimized several parts of the code, which makes it much faster than its initial version.

Hope you enjoy it!
