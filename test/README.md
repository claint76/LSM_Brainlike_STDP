# Test the SNN

Here I provide the Vectorized simulator for the SNN.

To initialize the test:

1) Use the provided netlist/netlist_new.txt, and only simulate one sample.

2) Enable the simulator dump by enable "_DUMP_RESPONSE" in def.h.

3) Disable CV and set one thread to run for one iteration.

4) Run the script: "run_test.sh"
